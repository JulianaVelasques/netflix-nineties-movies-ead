## :page_with_curl: About
This is a project from the Associate Data Scientist career track from DataCamp where 
I applied the foundational Python skills I learned in Introduction to Python (Course 1) and Intermediate Python (Course 2) by manipulating and visualizing movie data.

### The Challenge
Perform exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data to understand more about movies from the 1990s decade.

What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration (use 1990 as the decade's start year).

A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.


## :construction: Folder Structure
- `data/`: CSV data from Netflix.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook. Now it only contains one notebook where the EAD is performed.
- `requirement.txt`: Project dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Files/paths to be ignored by git.  
- `README.md`: This beautiful readme.

## :wrench: Built With
- [Python](https://docs.python.org)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplot](https://matplotlib.org/)

## ðŸ¤” How to Contribute

- Clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:JulianaVelasques/netflix-nineties-movies-ead.git`;
- Activate your virtual environment:
  - Linux/Mac: `source env/bin/activate`
  - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate `
- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`;
- Open Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`;
- Create your branch with your feature: `git checkout -b my-feature`;
- Commit your feature: `git commit -m 'feat: My new feature'`;
- Push to your branch: `git push -u origin my-feature`.

After the merge of your pull request is done, you can delete your branch.

## :grin: Notes
This is the first EAD I did all by myself without any help, only using the knowledge I acquired in courses 1 and 2 from the Associate Data Scientist career track (DataCamp). Although
the questions and solutions are really simple, the act of doing this by myself helped me to solidify my learning and create a solid beginning towards an amazing and exciting as a Data Scientist.
It was very satisfactory to investigate the data trying to find what is the most common duration of a movie in the 1990s and also find out that most of the action movies are not considered short.
I loved doing this exercise and I highly recommend you try it too.
